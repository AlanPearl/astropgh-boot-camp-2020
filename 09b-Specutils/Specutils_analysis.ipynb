Specutils provides a set of functions to provide these sorts of measurements, as well as similar summary statistics about spectral regions.  The [analysis part of the specutils documentation](https://specutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/analysis.html) provides a full list and detailed examples of these, but here we demonstrate some example cases."

For our examples here we will do this step \"by-eye\", but for a more detailed discussion of continuum modeling, see the next section.  Based on the above plot we estimate a continuum level for the area of the SDSS spectrum around the H-alpha emission line, and use basic math to construct the continuum-normalized and continuum-subtracted spectra."
